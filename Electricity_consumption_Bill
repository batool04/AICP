TASK:

Units of electricity consumption are given in the form of a matrix in source data. You are required to write user-defined functions and create a repeating menu in Python or C++ keeping in mind the following requirements:
1.The student's ID should be displayed at the top of the menu.
2. Press 1 to display the bill of slab 1 and slab 2. (Hint: In slab 1, the unit range is 0 to 100, each unit costs Rs.10, and the data of slab 1 is in the first row of the matrix. While in slab 2, the unit range is 101-200, each unit costs Rs.15, and the data of slab 2 is in the second row of 3.
the matrix) Press 2 to display the bill of slab 3.(Hint: In slab 3, the unit range is 201 to 300, each unit costs Rs.20, and the data of slab 3 is in the third row of the matrix.)
4. Press any other key to exit.


CODE:

Cost_matrix = [[55, 65, 75], [120, 150, 170], [210, 230, 240]]
print("Enter Your Choice")

    for i in range(len(first_row)):
        first_row[i] *= 10
    print("The Bill for Slab1 is:")
    print(first_row)

def costSlab2():
    first_row = Cost_matrix[1]
    for i in range(len(first_row)):
        first_row[i] *= 15
    print("The Bill for Slab2 is:")
    print(first_row)
   

def costSlab3():
    first_row = Cost_matrix[2]
    for i in range(len(first_row)):
        first_row[i] *= 20
    print("The Bill for Slab3 is:")
    print(first_row)

print("My student ID is xz4321")
slab1_2 = int(input("Press 1 to display the bill of Slab1 & Slab2\nPress 2 to display the bill of Slab3\nPress any other key to Exit \n "))

if slab1_2 == 1:
    costSlab1()
    costSlab2()
elif slab1_2 == 2:
    costSlab3()
else:
    pass

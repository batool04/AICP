The manager of a supermarket needs a program to record donations to charity. Each customer has the choice of three charities to donate to,
and 1% of their shopping bill will be donated to the chosen charity

# Task 1 - Set up the donation system

# Input charity names
charity_names = []
for i in range(3):
    charity_name = input(f"Enter the name of Charity {i+1}: ")
    charity_names.append(charity_name)

# Display charity names with numbers
for i, charity in enumerate(charity_names, start=1):
    print(f"{i}. {charity}")

# Input charity choice (1, 2, or 3)
charity_choice = int(input("Choose a charity (1, 2, or 3): "))
if charity_choice not in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("Invalid choice. Exiting.")
    exit()

# Input shopping bill value
shopping_bill = float(input("Enter the shopping bill amount: "))

# Calculate donation
donation = shopping_bill * 0.01

# Initialize totals for each charity
charity_totals = [0, 0, 0]

# Task 2 - Record and total each donation

# Add donation to the appropriate total
charity_totals[charity_choice - 1] += donation

# Output the name of the charity and the amount donated
chosen_charity = charity_names[charity_choice - 1]
print(f"Donation to {chosen_charity}: ${donation:.2f}")

# Display total donations for each charity
for i, total in enumerate(charity_totals, start=1):
    print(f"Total donation for Charity {i}: ${total:.2f}")




To find the grand total donated to charity:

Code:

# Initialize charity names and donation totals
charities = ["Charity 1", "Charity 2", "Charity 3"]
charity_totals = [0, 0, 0]

# Task 1: Set up the donation system
print("Welcome to the Charity Donation System!")
print("Available Charities:")
for i, charity in enumerate(charities, start=1):
    print(f"{i}. {charity}")

# Get charity choice
while True:
    try:
        choice = int(input("Choose a charity (1, 2, or 3): "))
        if 1 <= choice <= 3:
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter 1, 2, or 3.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

# Get shopping bill amount
bill_amount = float(input("Enter the shopping bill amount: "))

# Calculate donation and update totals
donation = 0.01 * bill_amount
charity_totals[choice - 1] += donation

# Task 2: Record and total each donation
print(f"Donation of ${donation:.2f} recorded for {charities[choice - 1]}.")

# Task 3: Show the totals so far
while True:
    try:
        choice = int(input("Choose a charity to show totals (-1 for grand total): "))
        if choice == -1:
            break
        elif 1 <= choice <= 3:
            print(f"{charities[choice - 1]} Total: ${charity_totals[choice - 1]:.2f}")
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter 1, 2, 3, or -1.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

# Display totals in descending order
sorted_charities = sorted(zip(charities, charity_totals), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
grand_total = sum(charity_totals)

print("\nCharity Totals:")
for charity, total in sorted_charities:
    print(f"{charity}: ${total:.2f}")

print(f"\nGRAND TOTAL DONATED TO CHARITY: ${grand_total:.2f}")
